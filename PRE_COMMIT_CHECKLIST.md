# Pre-Commit Security Checklist

Before pushing to GitHub, verify all sensitive data has been removed:

## ✅ Completed Security Steps

- [x] Removed `server/firebase-admin-key.json`
- [x] Removed sensitive Firebase keys from `attached_assets/`
- [x] Updated `client/src/firebase.ts` to use environment variables
- [x] Enhanced `.gitignore` with comprehensive exclusions
- [x] Created `.env.example` with placeholder values
- [x] Cleared user uploaded files from `uploads/`
- [x] Added setup documentation (README.md, SETUP.md)

## 🔍 Final Verification Commands

Run these commands to double-check:

```bash
# Check for any remaining sensitive keys
grep -r "AIza\|private_key\|client_email" . --exclude-dir=node_modules --exclude-dir=.git

# Verify no .env files are tracked
find . -name "*.env*" -not -name ".env.example"

# Check for Firebase admin keys
find . -name "*firebase*admin*" -o -name "*serviceAccount*"

# Verify uploads directory is clean
ls -la uploads/
```

## 📋 What's Safe to Commit

- ✅ All source code files
- ✅ `.env.example` (placeholder values only)
- ✅ Documentation files
- ✅ Configuration files (without secrets)
- ✅ Empty `uploads/.gitkeep` file

## 🚫 What Should NOT Be Committed

- ❌ `.env` files with real values
- ❌ Firebase admin service account JSON files
- ❌ User uploaded documents/files

Users will need to:

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
2. Fill in real Firebase configuration values
3. Set up Firebase project following SETUP.md
4. Configure database connection
5. Run `npm install` and `npm run db:push`

## 🛡️ Environment Variables Required

The following environment variables must be configured by users:

- `DATABASE_URL`
- `VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY`
- `VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN`
- `VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID`
