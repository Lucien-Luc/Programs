# Exact Git Commands to Fix Push Issue

## Current Situation
- Your local main is at commit: 42eb56a
- Remote main is at commit: 861eae1  
- These are different commit histories that need to be reconciled

## Solution: Run These Commands in Order

### Step 1: Force pull the remote state
```bash
git fetch origin main
git reset --hard origin/main
```

### Step 2: Re-apply your security changes
Since your changes are newer and more important (removing sensitive data), you'll need to re-stage your files:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "PRODUCTION READY: Complete security cleanup and form improvements

- Removed all sensitive Firebase credentials and API keys
- Updated Firebase config to use environment variables
- Enhanced .gitignore for comprehensive security
- Fixed form validation and removed image URL field
- Professional corporate form redesign with organized sections
- Created setup documentation and security checklists
- Project ready for safe GitHub deployment"
```

### Step 3: Push the changes
```bash
git push origin main
```

## Alternative: Force Push (if you're confident)
If you're sure your current state is what should be on GitHub:

```bash
git push --force origin main
```

⚠️ **Warning**: Force push will overwrite remote history. Only use if you're certain.

## What This Does
1. Downloads the latest remote state
2. Resets your local branch to match remote
3. Re-applies your security improvements
4. Pushes the clean, secure version to GitHub

Your project is ready - all sensitive data has been removed and documentation is complete!
