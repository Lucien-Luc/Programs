# Git Push Resolution Guide

## Current Situation
You're getting a "push rejected" error because the remote repository has commits that aren't in your local repository.

## Resolution Steps

### Option 1: Pull and Merge (Recommended)
```bash
# Pull the latest changes from remote
git pull origin main

# If there are merge conflicts, resolve them manually
# Then commit the merge
git commit -m "Merge remote changes"

# Now push your changes
git push origin main
```

### Option 2: Pull with Rebase
```bash
# Pull and rebase your commits on top of remote changes
git pull --rebase origin main

# If there are conflicts, resolve them and continue
git rebase --continue

# Push your changes
git push origin main
```

### Option 3: Force Push (Use with caution)
⚠️ **Only use if you're sure you want to overwrite remote changes**
```bash
git push --force-with-lease origin main
```

## What Likely Happened
- Someone else pushed changes to the repository
- Or the repository was initialized with a README/LICENSE file
- Your local branch diverged from the remote branch

## After Resolution
Once you successfully push, your project will be live on GitHub with all the security improvements we made:
- No sensitive credentials
- Environment variable configuration
- Professional documentation
- Clean codebase ready for collaboration

## Recommended Approach
I suggest using **Option 1** (pull and merge) as it's the safest approach that preserves all changes.
